Human Reaching Movement Trajectory Prediction using LSTM neural nets

The human reach movements were generated using LQG. SImple point to point reach movements. Image repesets start and end points. LQG controller gave the reach trajectories. LSTM is trained to predict the future trajectory of the reach movements. This is a simple demonstration.
